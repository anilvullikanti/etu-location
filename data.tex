\begin{enumerate}
\item
Add disease model
\item
Complete experimental design: capacities, times at which expt run
%\item Plot comparing tradeoff between average and max cost. Also need clarification
on Figure \ref{fig:kmed_vs_LP1}.
%\item Fix the observations on effects of uncertainty in Section \ref{sec:forecasting}. We also need a corresponding plot.
%\item Additional discussion about the incremental version in Section \ref{sec:incremental}. Is it the case that not all the demand is satisfied in this case, for some of the capacity choices? That needs to be specified.
\end{enumerate}
